in order to filter out a lines where a car costs more then 1000 the awk command was used

awk '$5 > 10000' cars_ORG 

it will take the fifth column and compare it to 10000 and then output the matching lines to the standard output (terminal)

the output will look like:

	ford    mustang 65      45      17000
	ford    ltd     83      15      10500
	ford    thundbd 84      10      17000
